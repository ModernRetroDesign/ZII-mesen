Please be sure to use the latest development build and not release version as of now otherwise it will not work correctly!

# Installation instructions

Extract ZII folder from zip into the Mesen HdPacks folder

A 200% overclock is recommended but not necessary. Set 'Additional scanlines before NMI' to 262. This option is located in the Emulation settings under Overclock.

A 32 pixel overscan is required to be applied to the top otherwise you will have a giant black bar on the upper part of the screen!

# Important note

The git is updated frequently and changes may occur, adding and removing content and features day by day.
