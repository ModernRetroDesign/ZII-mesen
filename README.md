# Installation instructions

Extract game from archive and rename to ZII

A 200% overclock is recommended but not necessary. Set 'Additional scanlines before NMI' to 262. This option is located in the Emulation settings under Overclock.

A 32 pixel overscan is required to be applied to the top otherwise you will have a giant black bar on the upper part of the screen!
